    "description": "You find yourself in a bit of a mess. The tunnel behind you has collapsed. There are two tunnels in front of you. One goes slightly left and the other slightly right. Looks like you'll have to take one to get out of here...",
    "left": "https://tunnels.incredible.health/b8e0436e-b489-4a43-8801-31f767e1cc83",
